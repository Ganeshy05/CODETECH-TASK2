Overview of the project:EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a database for managing employee records, including their personal details, job positions, departments, and salaries. This project will help you understand complex relationships and queries in SQL.

Components
Employees Table: Stores personal information about employees.

Departments Table: Stores information about different departments within the company.

Job Positions Table: Stores information about various job positions within the company.

Steps Involved
Designing Tables:

Create a Departments table with columns such as DepartmentID and DepartmentName.

Create a JobPositions table with columns such as JobID, JobTitle, and JobDescription.

Create an Employees table with columns such as EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, Address, Phone, Email, DepartmentID, JobID, Salary, and HireDate. Use foreign keys to link DepartmentID and JobID to their respective tables.

SQL Queries:

Insert Data: Insert sample data into the Departments, JobPositions, and Employees tables.

Update Data: Update records in the Employees table, such as changing the salary of an employee.

Delete Data: Delete records from the Employees table.

Retrieve Data: Retrieve data from the Employees table, as well as join queries to retrieve related data from the Departments and JobPositions tables.

Sample SQL Code
The SQL code for creating the tables and performing basic operations (insert, update, delete, retrieve) is provided in one file. You can copy and run this code in your SQL environment to create and manage the employee records database.

Expected Outputs
The expected outputs for each SQL query have been provided, showing how the data will be presented after executing the queries.
